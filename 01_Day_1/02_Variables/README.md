## Exercise 1
1. Create a variable named `temp`, with the value of `15`.
2. Create a variable named `temp_2`, with the value of `'15'`.
3. How do the variables `temp` and `temp_2` differ?
4. Try to perform operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) on these variables and see what the results are.


## Exercise 2
To check the type of variable you should use the keyword `type`.
If you have the variable `title` declared, you will check the type of the variable title using the command `type(title)`.

1. Check the types of the variables declared in the first exercise.
2. Write a program in which you check the type of a variable:
  a) if it is an integer, print out the variable multiplied by 5,
  b) if it is a Float, print out the variable divided by 5,
  c) if it is a string, simply print out the string on the screen.
