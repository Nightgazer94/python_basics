## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

Write a function `d6(num)` that simulates cubic die throws. `num` is the parameter, which denotes the number of die throws. The function should return the sum of the pips (dots) obtained.


## Exercise 2 - done with the lecturer

Write a function `tomorrow` that returns tomorrow's date.


## Exercise 3

Study the coderslab.py file included with this part of the exercises. Import the function `coderslab_welcome()`.
Call it and display the result on your screen.


## Exercise 4

Study the coderslab.py file included with this part of the exercises.
Import the list `words`. Add a function `random_word` to the module, that will return a random word from the list.
Import the written function and call it.


## Exercise 5
1. Create the directory `math_tools`, and in it - create a file named `functions.py`.
Add to it a `quadratic_function` which will take four parameters (x, a, b, c) and calculate the value of the quadratic function that has the formula ax^2 + bx + c.
2. Import this function and use it in another file that is located in the same directory as the file `functions.py`
3. Import this function and use it in another file that is above the math_tools directory.
